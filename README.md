### Efficiency & Patient Access
* **The Challenge:** Traditional hospital appointment booking via phone or in-person was time-consuming and prone to human error, resulting in inefficient clinic scheduling.
* **The Solution:** A 24/7 web-based appointment platform that allows patients to select available slots, reducing the administrative burden on hospital staff and providing instant confirmation to users.

### Key Features
* **Smart Scheduling:** Interactive date and time picker integrated with hospital department availability.
* **Service-Specific Booking:** Ability to choose specific medical clinics or health services (e.g., General, Dental, ANC).
* **Automated Data Capture:** Seamless collection of patient identifiers and appointment details for HIS integration.
* **Mobile-First Interface:** Optimized for accessibility on smartphones, which is the primary device for the majority of patients.
